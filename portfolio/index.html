                Hi, I’m Leevi—a game development student at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and an aspiring game programmer with a lot of interest in games and their the technical side.
                I have experience with programming languages like C# and Python, which I’ve applied in various projects throughout my studies.
                These projects have not only honed my technical skills but also strengthened my abilities in teamwork, problem-solving, and effective communication.
                Feel free to explore the projects I’ve worked on and see how I’ve applied my skills in practice.
            </p>
