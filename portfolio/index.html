                    <p>
                        I’m Leevi Lehtonen, an aspiring game programmer from Finland, currently in my fourth year studying Game Development at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve contributed to several game projects both as a solo developer and as part of a team. While I’ve primarily worked with Unity, I also have some experience with other engines like Unreal and Godot.
                        My main focus has been on gameplay programming.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I’m passionate about game development and always eager to learn and improve. I enjoy solving problems and figuring out how to bring ideas to life through code.
                        I also thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working as part of a team to build something great together. My goal is to create games that are fun, engaging, and polished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently looking for work opportunities. Feel free to explore the projects I’ve worked on.

            </div>
            <p>
                Spaceship Scavenger was created in 12 weeks by a team of 9 and was selected as a winner in the Bit1 competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spaceship Scavenger is a time limited puzzle game set in space. Player moves in an
                abandoned spaceship. The goal is to find the containment core and bring it back to
                your ship in a limited time while you have to avoid obstacles and solve puzzles.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, I created the player movement and implemented various tools they can use, such as a grappling tool and a cutting tool.
                I also made a lot of the interactable elements found in the level, checkpoint system and some UI stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a lot of fun working on this project and learned lot of valuable stuff when it comes to teamwork. Our team maintained good communication, and this project helped me truly appreciate its importance.
                Additionally, I enhanced my understanding of Git, including branching and conflict resolution.

                Game made in 48 hours by team of 6 during Global Game Jam.

            <p>
                In this game, your goal is to gather all your co-workers and escape undetected before your boss catches you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created the co-worker following system and implemented all of the animations.

                A recreation of chess that utilizes bot algorithm, done in C++.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was done in a course where I made a chess bot that you can play against. It was really interesting and fun to learn about algorithms and C++.

            <h3>Space Invaders</h3>
            <img class="mainimage" src="images/space_invaders01.png" alt="Space Invaders"> 
            <p>
                This was my first solo game development project—a remake of the classic title Space Invaders. 
                The game was created within the span of a month as part of a school project.
            </p>
            <p>
                This version of Space Invaders works similarly as regular Space Invaders. The player's goal is to eliminate all incoming waves of aliens by shooting them without allowing them to reach the bottom of the screen. 
                Only additions I made was updated visuals with better graphics, animations, and sounds. This version also has beginning and an end. The game consists of 5 levels and final boss. 
                This game was made using Unity as the engine and all the textures and animations were made by be.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this project I learned lot when it comes to using Unity and lot of good coding practices such as better naming conventions, breaking down code into smaller functions and separate scripts and avoiding overusing public variables / functions.
            </p>
