            <p>
                Iâ€™m Leevi, a game development student of Metroplolia University of Applied Sciences and an aspiring game programmer. 
                I have lot of interest in games and their technical side and have some experience with programming, using coding languages such as C# and Python. 
                I have been a student of Metroplolia University for nearly a year and have been participating in various projects. 
                Notably, I recently completed a solo game project during my time here.
