                This code randomizes the enemies shooting by using a list of every enemy in the scene. There is a cool down and when it becomes 0, it checks if there are active enemies in the scene. 
                If it finds enemies, it will go to loop and randomly generates different indexes from the enemy list and stops when it finds an active enemy from the list. Then it creates cool down.
            </p>

                This script is used to make a list of every enemy in the scene and also storing lot of different information about them. This list is very useful since it is used a lot in different scripts.
